questions:
->DO WE NEED TO DO USER MANAGEMENT VIA THE UI?? (register, login, verify, delete, edit, user roles)
        IF NOT, THEN MAKE THE DATABASE COLUMN ENCRYPTED AND JUST STORE THE PASSWORDS IN IT AS IS- 
        TO MAKE THE REGISTRATIONS BY HAND

notes:
- the session permanence is commented out for debugging purposes (or in general if i decide to do so)

pending:
- do some testing to check if everything is alright before starting with the menu links
        visibility thing (IDEA!! -> maybe REPLACE the Login with the Logout button!)
- menu links: all pages hidden and inacessible except login.
        on login success :
        JS: make these links visible on the menu bar
- menu links: Logout must be hidden unless logged in.
        on click :
        JS: hide logged in corresponding links

- fix the spacing for the login page (it is not very responsive!)
