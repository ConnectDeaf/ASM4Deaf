questions:
->DO WE NEED TO DO USER MANAGEMENT VIA THE UI?? (register, login, verify, delete, edit, user roles)
        IF NOT, THEN MAKE THE DATABASE COLUMN ENCRYPTED AND JUST STORE THE PASSWORDS IN IT AS IS- 
        TO MAKE THE REGISTRATIONS BY HAND


pending:
- when a user is not logged in, inform so with an alertbox (?) and redirect to login page
- menu: all pages hidden and inacessible except login.
        on login success :
                PYTHON: do session stuff to allow access to these pages,
                JS: make these links visible on the menu bar
- menu: must be hidden unless logged in.
        on click :
        PYTHON: clear session data,
        JS: hide corresponding links, redirect to Login page.
