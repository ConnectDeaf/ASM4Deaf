questions:
->DO WE NEED TO DO USER MANAGEMENT VIA THE UI?? (register, login, verify, delete, edit, user roles)
        IF NOT, THEN MAKE THE DATABASE COLUMN ENCRYPTED AND JUST STORE THE PASSWORDS IN IT AS IS- 
        TO MAKE THE REGISTRATIONS BY HAND

notes:
- the session permanence is commented out for debugging purposes (or in general if i decide to do so)

pending:
- how to return the images?? should their directory be available for everyone to access?


Meeting Notes:
- Implemented register, login, logout functionality and UI pages
        > Currently: must use database to verify and edit a user;
                   password cannot be changed, must remove user and re-register them.
- Add new GIF page
        > Works only for heads and torsos.
        > Still not sure how a fullbody GIF can be uploaded because the database record
                needs the head's and torso's ID to be created (so that they can be associated)
