questions:
->DO WE NEED TO DO USER MANAGEMENT VIA THE UI?? (register, login, verify, delete, edit, user roles)
        IF NOT, THEN MAKE THE DATABASE COLUMN ENCRYPTED AND JUST STORE THE PASSWORDS IN IT AS IS- 
        TO MAKE THE REGISTRATIONS BY HAND


pending:
- fix the spasing for the login page (it is not very responsive!)
- when a user is not logged in and tries to access a page they cannot, inform so with an alertbox (?) and redirect to login page
- menu: all pages hidden and inacessible except login.
        on login success :
                PYTHON: do session stuff to allow access to these pages,
                JS: make these links visible on the menu bar
- menu: Logout must be hidden unless logged in.
        on click :
        JS: hide logged in corresponding links
