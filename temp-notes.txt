questions:
->DO WE NEED TO DO USER MANAGEMENT VIA THE UI?? (register, login, verify, delete, edit, user roles)
        IF NOT, THEN MAKE THE DATABASE COLUMN ENCRYPTED AND JUST STORE THE PASSWORDS IN IT AS IS- 
        TO MAKE THE REGISTRATIONS BY HAND

notes:
- the session permanence is commented out for debugging purposes (or in general if i decide to do so)

pending:
- fix the spacing for the login page (it is not very responsive!)
- how to return the images?? should their directory be available for everyone to access?


meeting notes:
- created the login/logout functionality
