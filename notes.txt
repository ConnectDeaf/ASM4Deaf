questions:
->DO WE NEED TO DO USER MANAGEMENT VIA THE UI?? (register, login, verify, delete, edit, user roles)
        IF NOT, THEN MAKE THE DATABASE COLUMN ENCRYPTED AND JUST STORE THE PASSWORDS IN IT AS IS- 
        TO MAKE THE REGISTRATIONS BY HAND

notes:
- the session permanence is commented out for debugging purposes (or in general if i decide to do so)

pending:
- how to return the images?? should their directory be available for everyone to access?


Meeting Notes:

[DONE]
- Implemented a very generic database schema (can easily be extended)
- Implemented register, login, logout functionality and UI pages
        > Currently: must use database to verify and edit a user;
                   password cannot be changed, must remove user and re-register them;
                   no user roles, everyone is an Admin.
- Add new GIF page for heads and torsos.


[QUESTION]
- Can I have the GIFs exposed (i.e. anyone can access them if they have the right URL),
        or do I need to think of another approach?
        (-> use Base64 for GIF retrieval and data URIs for displaying them on the UI;
                use an input argument according to which the response will have the Base64
                or the URI- this is to make the UI rendering easier)


[PENDING]
- Create an endpoint that queries the database and returns the URLs/Base64/URIs for the matching GIFs
        among with their ids. (waiting for a reply to the QUESTION above)
- Create a query page for browsing what is already in the database
        (i.e. testing the endpoint mentioned above)
- Create an Add New GIF page for fullbody GIFs
        > Must allow the user to use similar functionality to the one of query page in order
                to select the head and torso which are combined by the fullbody that is to be
                uploaded. (to avoid manual search and typing of these 2 ids)
